Hello! I'm Justin, and I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://education.illinois.edu/edpsy). Specifically, I'm a member of the [QUERIES](https://education.illinois.edu/edpsy/programs-degrees/queries) (Quantitative and Qualitative Methodology, Measurement, and Evaluation) division. I like to think of QUERIES as the methods shop of the [College of Education](https://education.illinois.edu/). I align myself strongly as quantitative methodologist specializing in measurement and statistics as applied to education, psychology, and the behavioral sciences in general. Outside of my work, I like to spend time with my wife and cat, play music, and root for the Fighting Illini and for my beloved Detroit sports teams.

My background and history
------
I grew up in Michigan, but have spent the majority of my adult life in Central Illinois. I am a three-time graduate of UIUC, having received my MA and PhD in [Quantitative Psychology](https://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/psn/2016/01/quantitative-psychology) from the Psychology Department, and my MS in Statistics from the Statistics Department. I did my bachelor's degree with a double major in psychology and mathematics at Central Michigan University.
